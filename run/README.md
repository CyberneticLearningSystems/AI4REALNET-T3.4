# Training Scripts
This folder contains example training scripts for the various algorithms in ``src.algorithms``, specifically for Flatland. Currently implemented are: 
- Synchronous PPO 
    - Single worker version (``src.algorithms.PPO``)
    - Multiprocessing version (``src.algorithms.Sync_PPO``)
- Asynchronous PPO (``src.algorithms.IMPALA``)
